# ðŸ§ª Build Logs

This folder contains all structured logs from experimental builds, circuit tests, resonance tuning attempts, and energy capture trials within the **Ambient Resonance Energy** project.

It serves as the **primary record** for documenting hands-on work, measurement results, and iterative development.

---

## ðŸ“‹ Purpose

The goal of this log system is to:
- Maintain a **repeatable record** of each test or build iteration.
- Help identify what works, what doesnâ€™t, and why.
- Provide a clear audit trail as theory is translated into hardware.
- Allow future contributors or collaborators to pick up where others left off.
