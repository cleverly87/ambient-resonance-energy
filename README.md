# 🌍 Ambient Resonance Energy

Welcome to the **Ambient Resonance Energy** project repository. This initiative explores the theoretical and experimental potential of capturing ambient energy from Earth’s electromagnetic field—centered on the **Schumann Resonance (7.83 Hz)**.

---

## 🧠 Overview

This project is inspired by a blend of established science and unconventional ideas, including:

- **Schumann Resonance:** The Earth's natural ELF (extremely low frequency) waveform at ~7.83 Hz.
- **Motionless Electromagnetic Generator (MEG) concepts:** Investigating asymmetrical magnetic cores and pulsed magnetic excitation.
- **LC Resonance & Energy Feedback Systems:** Designed to emulate and potentially amplify ambient energy behavior.

Through theory, hands-on builds, and ongoing iteration, we aim to explore whether ambient energy systems can be constructed in practical and observable ways.

---

## 🎯 Project Goals

- **📖 Theoretical Modeling** – Refine and document resonant coil, capacitor, and magnetic structures.
- **🔧 Experimental Builds** – Construct and test resonant systems with tuned magnetic feedback.
- **🧪 Instrument Integration** – Use microcontroller code and tools like Bitscope for controlled pulse driving and signal observation.
- **🌐 Open Collaboration** – Build a space for like-minded engineers, makers, and researchers to exchange experiments and insights.
