# Ambient Resonance Energy

Welcome to the **Ambient Resonance Energy** project repository. This project explores the theoretical and experimental potential of harnessing ambient energy from the Earth's natural electromagnetic fieldsâ€”with a specific focus on the Schumann Resonance.

## Overview

The project delves into cutting-edge concepts inspired by:
- **Schumann Resonance:** Discover how the Earth naturally resonates at approximately 7.83 Hz, creating persistent ELF (extremely low frequency) fields that form the basis for our energy source hypothesis.
- **MEG Concepts:** Explore ideas based on Motionless Electromagnetic Generators (MEG) which utilize asymmetric magnetic cores and pulsed magnetic fields to potentially tap into ambient energy.

Through both theoretical research and experimental design, our mission is to develop innovative approaches to capture energy from these natural phenomena.

## Project Goals

- **Theoretical Research:** Refine conceptual models for resonant circuits and tuned coil systems that interact with the Earth's electromagnetic field.
- **Experimental Design:** Investigate materials, magnetic cores, and circuit configurations that enable ambient energy extraction.
- **Hardware & Software Integration:** Provide code for microcontrollers and Bitscope instruments to control and monitor testing. This integration will ease experimental setups and enable precise data capture.
- **Community Collaboration:** Build a collaborative environment for researchers, engineers, and enthusiasts to contribute ideas, experiments, and feedback.
